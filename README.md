## TODO

* [ ] Add license. Probably just MIT.
* [ ] Fill out README more completely.
* [ ] Add lemonbar, unibar, and raw/account apis.
* [ ] Fix the way that *Config* loading parses non-root paths provided.
* [ ] Add a string encoded default config to produce on first run if needed.
* [ ] Go back and comment throughout the project, most specifically in the *storage* module.
* [ ] Review dependencies to see if there is anything I can strip off of the dependency chart.

## DONE
* [x] REST API to actually get info.
* [x] Split *storage* module into seperate modules, file is over 400 lines of code..
* [x] Implement real event loop with error handling so all these Results I'm making are useful.
