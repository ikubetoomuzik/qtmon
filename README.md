* [x] Add a string encoded default config to produce on first run if needed.
* [x] Split *storage* module into seperate modules, file is over 400 lines of code..
* [x] Review dependencies to see if there is anything I can strip off of the dependency chart.
* [x] Implement real event loop with error handling so all these Results I'm making are useful.
